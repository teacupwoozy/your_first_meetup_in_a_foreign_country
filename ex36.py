# BAR

# Describe the terrace that has been converted to a make-shift bar, where people are standing around in small groups.

# Everyone seems to know each other and is speaking Spanish. Ug. Do you:
# 1. Turn around, leave, go home --> leave function
# 2. Decide to stay and try your best to learn something and talk to strangers.

# Give yourself something to do, walk up to the bar, and hold out your drink ticket.
# Bartender takes your drink ticket, gives the list of options
# Select your choice.

# The talk doesn't start for 30 minutes, what do you do?
# 1. Slam your beer and order more
    # How many more beers do you drink?
    # one more: drink it, then --> presentation room
    # 2 - 3 more: get lost trying to find bathroom, finally do and then discover there's no toilet paper. --> presentation room
    # 4+ more: Wander into the offices while trying to find the bathroom and end up locked in their bathroom. Miss 
    # presentations --> end game
# 2. Drink your beer (maybe make some friends)
    # A woman in a group standing next to you at the bar says hi. She's wearing blinking ÃŸrainbow LEDs in her hair.
    # 1. You tell her they're cool: she says thanks and starts telling you how she programmed them. You talk w the group.
        # A guy comes up with a bag of snacks, he lists them and asks which you would like.
        # leave and --> leave function
        # --> presentation room (skip where to sit)
    # 2. You take a swig of your beer, then --> presentation room
# 3. Take your beer into the presentation room (dodge creeper)
    # Good job! A creeper had been eyeing you and was just about to walk over and start hitting on you --> presentation room



# PRESENTATION ROOM
# Where to sit
# 1. Front row: in presenter's seat, have to move, loop back to where to sit
# 2. Few rows back: Good job! You can see and hear the presentations --> After presentations
# 3. Back of the room: can't hear, barely see anything. --> After presentations

# After presentations
# The presenations have finished, as you're getting up to leave you see s/o at the end of your row putting away a laptop with
# a bunch of R Studio stickers on it. You have been learning about large data sets and creating data visualizations, what do you do:
# 1. Leave --> leave function
# 2. Say in broken Spanish "What do you use R Studio for?" He works for a company using data for social justice projects. He
# invites you to a lunchtime talk later that week at his work. A co-worker will be talking about their latest data visualization project. 
# What do you do
# 1. Accept invite, attend talk, and ultimately land a great internship where you learn tons and work on great projects. This 
# work directly leads to your first job and a successful and exciting career in technology.
# 2. Make some non-commital reply and quickly --> Leave function
